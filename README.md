Rules

Archers

You have 3 archers to use. On any given turn you can either place a stone, place or replace* an archer, or retreat* all archers. Use the 1-4 keys to select your archer.

Once an archer is placed, it cannot be used again until it is removed from the board.

Archers and stones can't be placed in the flanks (the two outermost files, F and G).â€‹

*You can replace an archer with a normal stone to regain access to the archer without giving up the tile. Do this by clicking on the archer.
*Or you can retreat all archers, leaving their tiles empty. Do this by clicking while holding R

Conflict

When a column of pieces within a file is not sorted into two standalone color groups, conflict occurs, clearing all pieces except for the most recent places pieced in the conflict.

If the most recently placed piece is a stone it becomes the color of the side of the board it is on or does not change color if in the middle.

Winning and Losing

The game ends when two files are full or 1 tile away from being full. Full or nearly full flanks do not count toward ending the game. Whoever has the most pieces wins!
