RULES

​-Archers

​You have 3 archers to use. On any given turn you can either place a stone, place or replace* an archer, or retreat* all archers.

Once an archer is placed, it cannot be used again until it is removed from the board.

Archers can't be placed in the two leftmost files

*You can replace an archer with a normal stone to regain access to the archer without giving up the tile.
*Or you can retreat all archers, leaving their tiles empty.

​-Conflict

When a column of pieces within a file is not sorted into 2 standalone color groups, conflict occurs, clearing all pieces except for the most recent places pieced in the conflict.

If the most recently placed piece is a stone it becomes the color of the side of the board it is on or does not change color if in the middle.​

​-Winning and Losing

The game ends when three files are full or 1 tile away from being full. Whoever has the most pieces wins!
